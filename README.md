# Student Counseling System - Design Patterns
This repository demonstrates the application of creational design patterns as part of the Student Counseling Appointment Booking System. It includes implementations of Simple Factory, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, and Singleton patterns, along with unit tests to ensure correctness.

# Project Overview
The Student Counseling System provides functionality for:

Managing notifications for students and counselors.

Dynamically generating UI components for different user roles.

Ensuring consistent and controlled object creation using design patterns.

This project highlights how creational design patterns can simplify the system's architecture while maintaining scalability and modularity.
